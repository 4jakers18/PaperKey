Design Goals
------------
- Implentation of a TBD microcontroller with a TBD IO expander, to avoid a traditional matrix layout
- Allow for lower profile mechanical switches
- An ortholinear layout that includes a 12-key keypad
- Implementation of a 1.54 inch EPD module for monitoring/text/image display
