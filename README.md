# PaperKey
PaperKey is my attempt at an open-source Ortholinear keyboard PCB that includes a 1.54 E-paper display

Heavy inspiration from https://github.com/ZackFreedman/MiRage

Design Goals
------------
- Implentation of a TBD microcontroller with a TBD IO expander, to avoid a traditional matrix layout
- Allow for lower profile mechanical switches
- An ortholinear layout that includes a 12-key keypad
- Implementation of a 1.54 inch EPD module for monitoring/text/image display
